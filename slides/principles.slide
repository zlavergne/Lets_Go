Principles of Go

* Writeability
Go was designed to be a "quiet" written language.

Why stutter through

    foo.Foo* myFoo = new foo.Foo
when you can use `:=` declare-and-initialize construct.

- No forward declarations.
- No header files.

* Orthogonality
- Methods can be implemented for any type.
- Structures represent data, interfaces represent abstraction.
