* Principles of Go
---
** Writeability
  - Go was created to be a "quiet" language. Why stutter through `foo.Foo* myFoo = new foo.Foo` when you can use := declare-and-initialize construct.
  - No forward declarations.
  - No header files.

** Orthogonality
  - Methods can be implemented for any type.
  - Structures represent data, interfaces represent abstraction.
