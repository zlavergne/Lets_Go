Paradigms
---
* Imperative
  - Go has loops, statements, selection statements, which control the operational order, so it fits into the Imperative paradigm.
* Concurrent Logic
  - Go natively supports conncurency including multi-threading, multi-processing and asynchrony.
* Object Oriented
  - Kind of. Go does allow types and methods and has OOP writing style it does not have any class hierarchy other than interfaces.
